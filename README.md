Subtitle: "A Personal Development Journey"



Slide 2: Project Overview
Description:
The Chat App is a real-time messaging platform designed to facilitate seamless communication.
The goal was to create a reliable, fast, and user-friendly chat interface.
Developer:
Name: Benard Odhiambo.
Role: Full-stack developer (handled all aspects of design, development, and testing).


Architecture
Architecture Diagram:
Show a flowchart or diagram with components like:
Frontend: User interface where users send and receive messages.
Backend: Server handling message routing, user authentication, and storage.
Database: Stores user data and chat history.
WebSocket: Ensures real-time messaging.
Communication Flow:
User → Frontend → WebSocket → Backend → Database (and back).


4: Technologies Used
Frontend:
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and responsiveness.
Backend:
Python framework(Django)
Database:
SQL connected in django framework.
Real-time Communication:
WebSocket protocol implemented for instant message delivery.
Other Tools:
Postman for API testing.
Git for version control.


Slide 5: Development Progress
Achievements:
Successfully built and deployed a fully functional real-time chat application.
Implemented secure user authentication and data encryption.
Ensured cross-device compatibility (desktop and mobile).
Challenges:
Debugging WebSocket disconnection issues during high server loads.
Ensuring data consistency in real-time updates.
Areas for Improvement:
Add a better UI design to enhance the user experience.
Optimize backend for improved scalability.


Lessons Learned
Mastered WebSocket integration for real-time applications.
Gained experience in handling both frontend and backend development solo.
Learned the importance of debugging tools and systematic testing.
Understood how to design scalable architecture for real-time systems.



Slide 7: Next Steps
Short-term Goals:
Improve the UI/UX with modern frameworks (e.g., React).
Add features like file sharing or message search functionality.
Long-term Goals:
Deploy on a larger scale to handle multiple users concurrently.
Integrate advanced security measures like two-factor authentication.
